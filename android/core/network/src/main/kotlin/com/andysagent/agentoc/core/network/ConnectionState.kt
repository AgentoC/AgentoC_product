 * ADR-0001 v3 connection state types.

 * paired   — device config exists and awaits a verified bootstrap contract
 * reachable— TURN/P2P carrier responds
 * authenticated — device credential valid (challenge/verify succeeded)
 * connected — session API reachable through the selected carrier
 * degraded — was connected but probes are now failing
 * offline  — no verified carrier or network down
